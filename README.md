**Remarks about office hours:**
The regularly scheduled office hours listed above are subject to change.
Changes will be announced during lecture. Office hours are the hours during
which I make a point of being available in my office to answer questions.
However, students are encouraged to stop by my office at anytime to see if I'm
available. It is helpful (but not required) to [send me an email](mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com)
in advance to let me know when you plan to visit.

Attendance
----------
Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty may be exacted if you have an excessive number of unexcused absences.
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven
absences in total. 

However, since Math 207 is a large lecture, and because we will have near-weekly
quizzes, attendance should not be an issue for most students in this class.
Usually it only comes into play at the end of the semester if a student happens
to end up on the border between two letter grades.  In such cases, the professor
may look for things like an exemplary attendance record to justify moving the
student up into the next grade category. 

If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.


Asking Questions
----------------
When you don't understand something even after giving it some thought,
please ask a question!  The best time/place to do this is during lecture or in
office hours. 

The second best time/place to ask a question is on our
[Wiki pages](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math207-Spring2015/wiki).  Anyone
can read these pages, but to edit them and ask a question there, you need to
sign up for a (free) GitHub.com account. (This is not required, but I would
highly recommend GitHub to anyone who ever works on projects involving files
stored on a computer, which these days is essentially everyone.  GitHub is
especially good for collaborating on team projects.)

Another way to ask a question is by using the "Ask my instructor" link on
WebAssign. This method is convenient for the instructor because
details about the problem you're having trouble with are automatically embedded
in your email.

*Please note:* if you use the "Ask my instructor" button, your
question may appear on our wiki page (which is public).  If you're
uncomfortable with this, please say so in your message.

Finally, you may email the instructors directly, though the response
time might be significantly slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
above. 

**Important note about asking questions:** 
There are no stupid questions!  Students should ask about anything that seems
unclear. *However*, questions about specific homework problems should be
accompanied by evidence that the student has already given serious thought to
the problem.  Otherwise, the reply will usually be, "What have you tried?"

Use of Electronics During Lecture
---------------------------------
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.  The only exception to
this policy is the use of computers or tablets for the purpose of referring to
an electronic copy of the textbook, or the online (WebAssign) homework
problems. Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for
example, is totally unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to
focus on what is being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting 
to other students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated
to calculus will not be tolerated.**

Academic Honesty
----------------
Cheating will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to
and dealt with by the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs, in a  manner consistent
with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the
university.


Disabilities Statement
----------------------
If you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability
Resources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures. 
The Disability Resources Office is located in the Student Services
Building, Room 1076; phone number: 515-294-7220. The next step is to
see me. I am happy to assist with accommodations, but I will not
provide them retroactively (so file the appropriate requests and paperwork 
before the first exam!).

Classroom Policy
----------------
In this course, we follow the general university classroom policy: http://www.math.iastate.edu/Faculty/ClassPolicies.html
