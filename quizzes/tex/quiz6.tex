show your work!}

{\it Cheating will not be tolerated.}  If there is any indication that a
  student may have given or received unauthorized aid on this test, the case 
  will be handed over immediately to the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs.% \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item (6 points)
Determine whether the set $S$ spans $R^2$. If the set does not span $R^2$, then
give a geometric description of the subspace that it does span. 

\[S = 
\{(3, 2), (−6, −4), (\frac{3}{2}, 1)\}
\]

{\bf Answer here:}
(fill in the circle next to the correct answer)  
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\circ$] $S$ spans $R^2$
\item[$\circ$] $S$ spans a point in $R^2$
\item[$\circ$] $S$ spans a line in $R^2$
\item[$\circ$] $S$ spans a plane in $R^2$
\end{itemize}

\item (6 points)
Consider the following set of vectors in $R^2$
\[
S = \{s_1, s_2, s_3\} = \{(3, 2), (−1, 1), (2, 0)\}.
\]
Show that $S$ is linearly dependent by writing $s_1$ as a linear combination of
$s_2$ and $s_3$.

\item (6 points)
For the set $S$ in Question 2, say whether each 
statement below is true or false.  Write your answer on the line provided.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The set $S$ is a basis for $R^2$ \hfill \underline{\phantom{XXXXXXXXX}}
\item The vectors in $S$ span $R^2$ \hfill \underline{\phantom{XXXXXXXXX}}
\item The vectors in $S$ span $R^3$ \hfill \underline{\phantom{XXXXXXXXX}}
\end{enumerate}
